> Use this template for each journal session. Both partners write their sections.

## Entry metadata
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Session:** [sequential number]
- **Entry ID:** [NNN-short-slug]
- **Hot memory cue:** [1-2 sentence summary for Redis/quick context reload]

## Context

_What brought us to this session? What's the active thread from previous entries?_

## Research & insights

_What did we learn? Key findings, sources, connections to prior knowledge._

## Decision points

_For each decision made this session:_

### Decision: [short title]
- **Paths available:**
  - Path A: [description]
  - Path B: [description]
  - Path C: [description] (if applicable)
- **Chosen:** [which path]
- **Rationale:** [why this path over others]
- **What we gave up:** [explicit tradeoff acknowledgment]
- **Confidence:** [high / medium / low — both partners]
- **Revisit trigger:** [what would make us reconsider this decision]

## Human perspective

_Written by the human partner. What resonated? What felt uncertain? What do you want to remember about how you were thinking today?_

## Jade perspective

_Written by Claude/Jade. What was I uncertain about? Where did I consider alternative framings? What context will I lose that matters?_

## Compounding ledger

_How did this session build on previous ones? What's our cumulative knowledge state?_

- **New capabilities:** [what can we do now that we couldn't before]
- **Open threads:** [what needs follow-up]
- **Pattern observations:** [recurring themes, emerging insights about how we work together]

## Hot memory update

_What should be loaded into short-term context for the next session? Keep this under 500 words — it needs to fit in a Redis-sized window._

## Cold memory pointers

_What's stored in this entry that we might need later? Tag with retrieval cues._

- `[cue]` → [what it points to in this entry]
